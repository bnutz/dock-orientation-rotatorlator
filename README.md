# Dock Orientation Rotatorlator #

### Description ###

Automatically lock / unlock the rotation setting of your Android device when you plug / unplug the power cable.

Can set the device to either lock or unlock the display rotation setting when the USB cable is plugged in or unplugged, or when entering / exiting wireless charging.

Useful for those who use docks in landscape mode, but need to lock to portrait when taking off the dock.


(Actually this is just a really over-engineered excuse for me to play with Animated Vector Drawables...)
